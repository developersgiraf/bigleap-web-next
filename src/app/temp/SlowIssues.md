# JS Slow Issues Identified

1. **Sass Compiler** - `import { FALSE } from "sass"` in `src/app/page.jsx` (Line 21) = (721 ms)
   - **File**: slow01.js (187,812 lines)
   - **Issue**: Entire Sass compiler bundled client-side
   - **Impact**: Massive bundle size, slow parsing/compilation
   - **Fix**: Remove import, use regular JavaScript boolean

2. **Immutable.js Library** - Full Immutable.js data structures library =   (557ms)
   - **File**: slow02.js (4,087 lines)
   - **Issue**: Complete Immutable.js library with Collection, Map, List, Set, Stack, Record
   - **Impact**: Large bundle for immutable data structures (likely unused or over-engineered)
   - **Fix**: Check if actually needed, consider native JS objects or lighter alternatives

3. **Next.js App Router** - Next.js App Router system and routing infrastructure = (431ms)
   - **File**: slow03.js (9,636 lines)
   - **Issue**: Complete App Router system with useRouter, parallelRoutes, action dispatching
   - **Impact**: Large routing system (may be necessary but worth optimizing)
   - **Fix**: This is likely necessary for Next.js app, but check for unused router features

4. **React DOM** - Complete React DOM library and reconciler = (431ms)
   - **File**: slow04.js (11,383 lines)
   - **Issue**: Full React DOM with all React symbols, rendering, hydration, event handling
   - **Impact**: Large but essential React DOM library for React applications
   - **Fix**: This is necessary for React apps, but ensure using production build

5. **Framer Motion** - Complete animation and motion library = (348ms)
   - **File**: slow05.js (7,760 lines)
   - **Issue**: Full Framer Motion with transform utilities, animation controls, gesture handling
   - **Impact**: Large animation library - may be overkill for simple animations
   - **Fix**: Check if all features are used, consider lighter CSS animations for simple effects

6. **CSS Modules** - Compiled CSS class name mappings = (127ms)
   - **File**: slow06.js
   - **Issue**: All CSS module class mappings for components (hero, blog, enquiry, etc.)
   - **Impact**: Necessary for CSS modules but can accumulate
   - **Fix**: This is expected, but check for unused styles and optimize CSS

7. **Swiper.js** - Complete carousel/slider library = (101ms)
   - **File**: slow07.js
   - **Issue**: Full Swiper library with navigation, pagination, touch gestures, effects
   - **Impact**: Large carousel library - may include unused features
   - **Fix**: Check if all Swiper features are used, consider lighter slider alternatives
