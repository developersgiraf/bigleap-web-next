    "Descpara": "VFX (Visual Effects) involves utilizing CGI to create or manipulate images or footage to enhance the visual elements in a scene. It often involves incorporating objects, phenomena and characters that exist outside reality and blending them effectively to create a captivating experience. The scenes which require VFX are shot on green screens and the effects are integrated later. Post-production is the process of finalizing the filming process and involves the following steps such as editing, sound design and mixing, compositing, colour correction and grading, VFX and title and credits.",
